As a customer, I would like to see a list of data with image, title, and
date from https://jsonkeeper.com/b/WN0G. I also would like to see a
details screen with a description along with other data. I want to see
the app in landscape mode as well. If I do not have an internet
connection, I would like to see the last data if available.
